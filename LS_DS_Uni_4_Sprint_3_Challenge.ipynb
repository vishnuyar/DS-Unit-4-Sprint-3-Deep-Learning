    "In this sprint challenge, you'll explore some of the cutting edge of Data Science. This week we studied several famous neural network architectures: \n",
    "recurrent neural networks (RNNs), long short-term memory (LSTMs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and Generative Adverserial Networks (GANs). In this sprint challenge, you will revisit these models. Remember, we are testing your knowledge of these architectures not your ability to fit a model with high accuracy. \n",
    "\n",
    "__*Caution:*__  these approaches can be pretty heavy computationally. All problems were designed so that you should be able to achieve results within at most 5-10 minutes of runtime on Colab or a comparable environment. If something is running longer, doublecheck your approach!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenge Objectives\n",
    "*You should be able to:*\n",
    "* <a href=\"#p1\">Part 1</a>: Train a RNN classification model\n",
    "* <a href=\"#p2\">Part 2</a>: Utilize a pre-trained CNN for objective detection\n",
    "* <a href=\"#p3\">Part 3</a>: Describe the components of an autoencoder\n",
    "* <a href=\"#p4\">Part 4</a>: Describe yourself as a Data Science and elucidate your vision of AI"
